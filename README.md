# Sample-Store-Analysis-using-Microsoft-Excel
## Overview:
This project aims to analyze sales data from a sample store using Microsoft Excel. We utilize PivotTables and PivotCharts for data analysis and visualization.

## Pivot Table Creation:
1. Select all data and create a PivotTable in a new worksheet.
2. Choose columns for analysis (e.g., customer name, sales, profit, ship mode) in the PivotTable Field List.

## Visualization:
- Use PivotCharts to visualize data.

## Additional Notes:
- Ensure data consistency and cleanliness before analysis.
- Experiment with different chart types for better insights.
- Save your work periodically to prevent data loss.
